                        <p>Zeke’s Coffee is a local, small batch, family owned coffee roastery that is seriously committed to freshness. </p>
                        <p>What makes us awesome: At Zeke’s, we use a fluid bed coffee roaster. Invented by Mike Sivetz, a physicist from Oregon in the 1970’s, fluid bed coffee roasters use hot air to create a fountain of coffee beans.This technique roasts more quickly and uniformly than a conventional drum roaster. We roast to temperature, giving us a more consistent product. Chaff escapes the roast chamber easily, leading to cleaner tasting coffee with more distinct regional flavors. We roast in small batches. It guarantees freshness. It keeps us honest. Our roaster holds 30 pounds of coffee, compared to the 150 pounds that a standard roaster holds. Because of this, we put more time, more labor, and a little more of ourselves into each bean. You can taste the difference.</p>
                        <p>Even as we expand out of Baltimore, we stay committed to roasting in small batches. Our roastery in Washington DC and Pittsburgh use 12 pound roasters. Where it all started: Zeke’s coffee started with a man and a one pound coffee roaster. Thomas Rhodes sold his first pound of coffee at Baltimore Farmers’ Market in November 2005, and opened a retail space in Lauraville in NE Baltimore on April 22, 2006. On February 26, 2010, we opened our first cafe at 4607 Harford Road. Zeke’s can also be found year round at the 32nd Street Market in Waverly and seasonally at several markets in and around Baltimore.</p>

                        <p>As a strong supporter of our community at large, On the Hill Cafe strives through programs such as Clean Currents and Waste Neutral, to act as a good corporate citizen to do our part in improving the community around us. 100% of our electricity comes from wind power, we compost and/or recycle all outgoing waste, and our cooking oil is repurposed as biodiesel fuel. Together with our neighbors, we are making a difference in the way communities and businesses partner with each other to make tomorrow better for everyone.</p>
                        <p>We pride ourselves in serving high quality, natural food. We carry organic and local produce when possible. Our eggs come weekly from Springfield Farms. Our ground beef and turkey are humane certified no hormones, no antibiotics. </p>
                        <p>“At first sight, On the Hill Cafe has an early '90s coffeehouse-meets-sub-shop look, which, after a little observation, gives way to a warmer, more local vibe. On a recent visit, there was local art on the walls, children's books in the corner and a server going out of his way to help an overwhelmed mother of two. It's clear this joint cares — not just about the customers, but the food as well.” - The Baltimore Sun Review</p>

                        <p>The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is internationally renowned for its collection of art. The collection presents an overview of world art from pre-dynastic Egypt to 20th-century Europe, and counts among its many treasures Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi; medieval ivories and Old Master paintings; Art Nouveau jewelry and 19th-century European and American masterpieces.</p>
                        <p>As you walk through the galleries of the Walters Art Museum, you may be struck by the remarkable beauty and breadth of its collection. More remarkable still, is the fact that this collection was born of the artistic interest and public-mindedness of just two men: William Thompson Walters and his son, Henry. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the two Baltimoreans assembled a diverse range of artwork from around the world—including everything from European master paintings and decorative arts to Greek and Roman antiquities and Far Eastern ceramics. Together, they collected nearly 22,000 works of art, and in doing so, they built the foundation for a museum that offers a one of- a-kind survey of 55 centuries of art.</p>
                        <p>Today, the collection has grown to more than 35,000 objects. From ancient Egyptian mummy masks and medieval armor, to 19th-century French impressionism and turn-of-the-century art deco, you will see significant works of art from around the world.</p>
                        <p>The Walters' redesigned galleries present the museum’s world-class collections to their fullest potential. Our installations evoke the original manner in which the art was displayed, and in turn, provide greater insights into the art and a more personal and rewarding viewer experience.</p>

                        <p>The Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall has been the home of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra since its opening on September 16, 1982. Among the most recognizable structures in Baltimore, the unique, circular building has become the artistic and cultural hub of Baltimore, serving as a world-class performance space for the BSO. Named for the late Baltimore philanthropist and former BSO president, Joseph Meyerhoff, the 2,443-seat hall has been hailed for its pristine acoustics and versatility.</p>
                        <p>The building was uniquely designed by the architectural firms of Pietro Belluschi, Inc. and Jung/Brannen Associates, and combined glass, brick and wood to create both an elegant and modern concert hall. The hall was constructed without flat walls or ninety-degree angles and posesses state of the art acoustics that use a series of convex curves to avoid concentration of sound. Mounted above the stage were 18 convex curved discs suspended at different angles to reflect the sound from the Orchestra evenly throughout the hall. Every one of the 2,443 seats has an unobstructed view of the stage, and it is one of the few halls in the country that has box seats over the stage.</p>
                        <p>In 1997, the BSO began a five-year renovation. The work culminated in the summer of 2001 with the installation of a new acoustic canopy, replacing the original convex disks. The canopy has been designed to more effectively blend the sound of the orchestra on stage and to better project the sound into the Hall. Additional renovations have been completed behind the scenes to improve the overall performance experience for musicians and audiences, such as a renovated and modernized musicians’ lounges and dressing rooms, a green room renamed the Zamoiski Room in honor of the BSO’s Chairman Emeritus, Calman “Buddy” Zamoiski and his wife, Ellen, improved accessibility for patrons with physical disabilities, and the creation of the Georgia and Peter Angelos Governing Members Lounge. </p>
                        <p>Most recently, in the fall of 2007, Maestra Marin Alsop’s dressing room was the subject of a “dressing room makeover,” featured in Style Magazine. Consulting closely with Maestra Alsop, a team of local designers transformed the space into a stylish, contemporary suite.</p>
